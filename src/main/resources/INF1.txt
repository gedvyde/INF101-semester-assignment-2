Year 1:

"Fadder" week was fun, I hope you had some much
 needed rest, but now life starts for real.

In your first year, you'll face manageable exams
and the daily grind of student life. Utilize the items
at your disposal, including the comforting
embrace of a cozy bed and the financial aid of
a stipend, to ease your transition into university life.

During your three-year education, you've
got 3 "konte" attempts. So don't worry if things
don't go as planned; you've can always retake you exams!
